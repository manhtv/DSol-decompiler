# DSol
A practical Ethereum smart contract decompiler


## What does DSol do?

DSol translates the raw EVM bytecode of a smart contract into a high-level language that resembles Solidity.

## Usage

TODO


## What is DSol useful for?

You can use DSol to:
- validate the output of the Solidity compiler
- understand how Solidity language features are implemented at the EVM level
- understand and audit contracts without public source code
- help recover lost source code
- discover backdoors and compiler bugs (if any)

## About the project

DSol is the result of half a year's full-time work on my master's thesis. For technical details and documentation, see my [thesis](https://github.com/tehybel/DSol-decompiler/raw/master/thesis/DSol-thesis-Thomas-Hybel.pdf).
